<h1> Bomb lab Keegan Mullins

<h3> The purpose of this lab is to determine the correct input for the psol.txt text file read by the bomb program. This was done by reading the assembly code for the file to determine the correct input to not make the bomb "explode".

<h3> There were 6 levels to this problem, each increasing in difficulty.
